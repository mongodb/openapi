                This setting configures the ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` to redact any document field contents from a message accompanying a given log event before logging. This prevents the program from writing potentially sensitive data stored on the database to the diagnostic log. Metadata such as error or operation codes, line numbers, and source file names are still visible in the logs.

                Use ``redactClientLogData`` in conjunction with Encryption at Rest and TLS/SSL (Transport Encryption) to assist compliance with regulatory requirements.

                By default, Atlas scales under WORKLOAD_TYPE. This mode allows Atlas to scale your analytics nodes in parallel to your operational nodes.

                When configured as SEQUENTIAL, Atlas scales all nodes sequentially. This mode is intended for steady-state workloads and applications performing latency-sensitive secondary reads.

                When configured as NODE_TYPE, Atlas scales your electable nodes in parallel with your read-only and analytics nodes. This mode is intended for large, dynamic workloads requiring frequent and timely cluster tier scaling. This is the fastest scaling strategy, but it might impact latency of workloads when performing extensive secondary reads.

The region name is only returned in the response for single-region clusters. When MongoDB Cloud deploys a dedicated cluster, it checks if a VPC or VPC connection exists for that provider and region. If not, MongoDB Cloud creates them as part of the deployment. It assigns the VPC a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block. To limit a new VPC peering connection to one Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block and region, create the connection first. Deploy the cluster after the connection starts. GCP Clusters and Multi-region clusters require one VPC peering connection for each region. MongoDB nodes can use only the peering connection that resides in the same region as the nodes to communicate with the peered VPC.
