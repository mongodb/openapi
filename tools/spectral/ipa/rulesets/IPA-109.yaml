functions:

rules:
  xgen-IPA-109-custom-method-must-be-GET-or-POST:
    description: |
      The HTTP method for custom methods must be GET or POST.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to paths containing custom method identifiers (with colon format)
        - Verifies the HTTP methods used are either GET or POST
        - Fails if any other HTTP methods are used (PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.)
        - Fails if multiple valid methods are defined for the same custom method endpoint

  xgen-IPA-109-custom-method-must-use-camel-case:
    description: |
      The custom method must use camelCase format.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to paths containing custom method identifiers (with colon format)
        - Extracts the method name portion following the colon
        - Verifies the method name is not empty or blank
        - Validates that the method name uses proper camelCase formatting
        - Fails if the method name contains invalid casing (such as snake_case, PascalCase, etc.)

  xgen-IPA-109-custom-method-identifier-format:
    description: |
      Custom methods must be defined using a colon followed by the method name.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Identifies paths containing a colon (potential custom methods)
        - Validates that the path follows proper custom method format
        - Does not validate after the colon (xgen-IPA-109-custom-method-must-use-camel-case rule validates the method name)
        - Fails if a slash appears before a colon
        - Fails if multiple colons appear in the path
        - Fails if other than an alphabetical character or a closing curly brace appears before a colon
