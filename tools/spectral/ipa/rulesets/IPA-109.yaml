rules:
  xgen-IPA-109-custom-method-must-be-GET-or-POST:
    description: |
      The HTTP method for custom methods must be GET or POST.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to paths containing custom method identifiers (with colon format)
        - Verifies the HTTP methods used are either GET or POST
        - Fails if any other HTTP methods are used (PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.)
        - Fails if multiple valid methods are defined for the same custom method endpoint
    message: '{{error}} https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-109-custom-method-must-be-GET-or-POST'

  xgen-IPA-109-custom-method-must-use-camel-case:
    description: |
      The custom method must use camelCase format.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to paths containing custom method identifiers (with colon format)
        - Extracts the method name portion following the colon
        - Verifies the method name is not empty or blank
        - Validates that the method name uses proper camelCase formatting
        - Fails if the method name contains invalid casing (such as snake_case, PascalCase, etc.)

  xgen-IPA-109-custom-method-identifier-format:
    description: |
      Custom methods must be defined using a colon followed by the method name.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Identifies paths containing a colon (potential custom methods)
        - Validates that the path follows proper custom method format
        - Does not validate after the colon (xgen-IPA-109-custom-method-must-use-camel-case rule validates the method name)
        - Fails if a slash appears before a colon
        - Fails if multiple colons appear in the path
        - Fails if other than an alphabetical character or a closing curly brace appears before a colon

  xgen-IPA-109-valid-operation-id:
    description: |
      The Operation ID must start with the custom method verb (the custom method path section delimited by the colon (:) character) and should be followed by a noun or compound noun.
      If the custom Operation ID has a verb + noun, the Operation ID should end with the noun.
      The noun(s) in the Operation ID should be the collection identifiers from the resource identifier.
      The noun(s) in the Operation ID should be the collection identifiers from the resource identifier in singular form, where the last noun:
        - Is in plural form if the method applies to a collection of resources
        - Is in singular form if the method applies to a single resource

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to paths containing custom method identifiers (with colon format)
        - Confirms that the existing OperationId is compliant with generated IPA Compliant OperationId

      ##### Configuration
      This rule includes one configuration options:
        - `ignoreSingularizationList`: Words that are allowed to maintain their assumed plurality (e.g., "Fts")
