# IPA Validation Rules

All Spectral rules used in the IPA validation are defined in rulesets grouped by IPA number (`IPA-XXX.yaml`). These rulesets are imported into the main IPA ruleset [ipa-spectral.yaml](https://github.com/mongodb/openapi/blob/main/tools/spectral/ipa/ipa-spectral.yaml) which is used for running the validation.

#### xgen-IPA-117-plaintext-response-must-have-example

 ![error](https://img.shields.io/badge/error-red) 
For APIs that respond with plain text, for example CSV, API producers must provide an example. Some tools are not able to generate examples for such responses

##### Implementation details
  - The rule only applies to 2xx responses
  - The rule ignores JSON and YAML responses (passed as `allowedTypes`)
  - The rule ignores responses with `format: 'binary'` (i.e. file types)
  - The rule checks for the presence of the example property as a sibling to the `schema` property, or inside the `schema` object

#### xgen-IPA-117-objects-must-be-well-defined

 ![error](https://img.shields.io/badge/error-red) 
Components of type "object" must be well-defined, i.e. have of one of the properties:
  - `schema`
  - `examples`
  - `example`
  - `oneOf`, `anyOf` or `allOf`
  - `properties`
  - `additionalProperties`

##### Implementation details
The rule applies to the following components:

  - Inline operation response/request body array items (JSON only)
  - Schemas defined in `components/schemas`
  - Schema properties defined in `components/schemas`
  - `items` properties defined in `components/schemas`
The rule is applied to the unresolved OAS, and ignores components with `$ref` properties. Specific paths can be ignored using the `ignoredPaths` option.

#### xgen-IPA-117-parameter-has-examples-or-schema

 ![error](https://img.shields.io/badge/error-red) 
API producers must provide a well-defined schema or example(s) for parameters.

  - Operation parameters
  - Parameters defined in `components/parameters`

#### xgen-IPA-117-operation-summary-format

 ![warn](https://img.shields.io/badge/warning-yellow) 
Operation summaries must use Title Case, must not end with a period and must not use CommonMark.

##### Implementation details
The rule checks that the `summary` property of all operations are in Title Case.

##### Configuration
This rule includes two configuration options:
  - `ignoreList`: Words that are allowed to maintain their specific casing (e.g., "API", "AWS", "DNS")
  - `grammaticalWords`: Common words that can remain lowercase in titles (e.g., "and", "or", "the")



### IPA-118

Rules are based on [https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/118](https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/118).

#### xgen-IPA-118-no-additional-properties-false

 ![error](https://img.shields.io/badge/error-red) 
Schemas must not use `additionalProperties: false`

##### Implementation details
This rule checks that schemas don't restrict additional properties by setting `additionalProperties: false`.
Schemas without explicit `additionalProperties` settings (which default to true) or with `additionalProperties` set to `true` are compliant.
This rule checks all nested schemas, but only parent schemas can be marked for exception.



### IPA-119

Rules are based on [https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/119](https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/119).

#### xgen-IPA-119-no-default-for-cloud-providers

 ![error](https://img.shields.io/badge/error-red) 
When using a provider field or parameter, API producers should not define a default value.
This rule checks fields and parameters named "cloudProvider" and ensures they do not have a default value.
It also checks enum fields that might contain cloud provider values.
All cloudProviderEnumValues should be listed in the enum array.



### IPA-121

Rules are based on [https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/121](https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/121).

#### xgen-IPA-121-date-time-fields-mention-iso-8601

 ![error](https://img.shields.io/badge/error-red) 
Fields with format="date-time" should mention ISO 8601 and UTC in their description.
It collects adoption metrics at schema property level and parameter level



### IPA-123

Rules are based on [https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/123](https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/123).

#### xgen-IPA-123-enum-values-must-be-upper-snake-case

 ![error](https://img.shields.io/badge/error-red) 
Enum values must be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.

##### Implementation details
Rule checks for the following conditions:
  - Applies to all enum value arrays defined in the OpenAPI schema
  - Resolves the schema object that contains the enum values
  - Validates each enum value individually against the UPPER_SNAKE_CASE pattern
  - Skips validation if the schema has an exception defined for this rule

#### xgen-IPA-123-allowable-enum-values-should-not-exceed-20

 ![error](https://img.shields.io/badge/error-red) 
Allowable enum values should not exceed 20 entries.

##### Implementation details
Rule checks for the following conditions:
  - Validates that each enum set has 20 or fewer values
  - Skips validation if the schema has an exception defined for this rule
  - This validation threshold can be adjusted by changing the functionOptions.maxEnumValues parameter



### IPA-124

Rules are based on [https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/124](https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/124).

#### xgen-IPA-124-array-max-items

 ![error](https://img.shields.io/badge/error-red) 
Array fields must have a `maxItems` property defined to enforce an upper bound on the number of items (recommended max: 100). If the array field has the chance of being too large, the API should use a sub-resource instead.

##### Implementation details
Rule checks for the following conditions:

  - All schema objects with type 'array' must have a `maxItems` property
  - The `maxItems` value must be lower than or equal to 100

##### Function options
        - maxAllowedValue: Required integer parameter specifying the maximum allowed value for the `maxItems` property (100)
        - ignore: Required array parameter listing property names to be exempted from validation



### IPA-125

Rules are based on [https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/125](https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/125).

#### xgen-IPA-125-oneOf-must-have-discriminator

 ![error](https://img.shields.io/badge/error-red) 
Each oneOf property must include a discriminator property to define the exact type.

##### Implementation details
Rule checks for the following conditions:
  - Applies only to schemas with `oneOf` containing references
  - Ensures a `discriminator` property is present with a valid `propertyName`
  - Validates that `discriminator.mapping` contains exactly the same number of entries as `oneOf` references
  - Validates that each `discriminator.mapping` value matches a reference in the `oneOf` array
  - Ignores `oneOf` definitions with inline schemas

##### Matching Logic
- The `discriminator.mapping` must have the same number of entries as there are references in the `oneOf` array
- Each value in the `discriminator.mapping` must match one of the `$ref` values in the `oneOf` array
- Each `$ref` in the `oneOf` array must have a corresponding entry in the `discriminator.mapping`
- Example:
  ```yaml
  oneOf:
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Dog'
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Cat'
  discriminator:
    propertyName: type
    mapping:
      dog: '#/components/schemas/Dog'
      cat: '#/components/schemas/Cat'
  ```
  This is valid because there are exactly 2 mappings for 2 oneOf references, and all values match.

#### xgen-IPA-125-oneOf-no-base-types

 ![error](https://img.shields.io/badge/error-red) 
API producers should not use oneOf with different base types like integer, string, boolean, or number or references at the same time.

##### Implementation details
Rule checks for the following conditions:
  - Applies to schemas with `oneOf` arrays
  - Ensures no mixing of base types with references
  - Ensures no multiple different base types in the same oneOf
  - Base types considered are: integer, string, boolean, number
  - Using the same base type multiple times is allowed (e.g., multiple string enums)

##### Rationale
Using oneOf with multiple primitive types can lead to ambiguity and validation problems. Clients may not 
be able to properly determine which type to use in which context. Instead, use more specific 
object types with clear discriminators.

#### xgen-IPA-125-oneOf-schema-property-same-type

 ![warn](https://img.shields.io/badge/warning-yellow) 
If multiple `oneOf` models define a property with the same name, that property **must** have the same base type or schema in each model

##### Implementation details
Rule checks for the following conditions:
  - Applies only to object type schemas with `oneOf`
  - Ensures that if a property is defined in multiple `oneOf` schemas, it must have the same type in each schema (base type or object schema)

#### xgen-IPA-125-discriminator-must-accompany-oneOf-anyOf-allOf

 ![warn](https://img.shields.io/badge/warning-yellow) 
Each discriminator property must be accompanied by a `oneOf`, `anyOf` or `allOf` property 

##### Implementation details
- Rule checks that a `discriminator` property has a `oneOf`, `anyOf` or `allOf` sibling



### IPA-126

Rules are based on [https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/126](https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/126).

#### xgen-IPA-126-tag-names-should-use-title-case

 ![error](https://img.shields.io/badge/error-red) 
Tag names in the OpenAPI specification should use Title Case.

##### Implementation details
Rule checks for the following conditions:
  - All tag names defined in the OpenAPI tags object should use Title Case 
  - Title Case means each word starts with an uppercase letter, and the rest are lowercase
  - Certain abbreviations (like "API", "AWS", etc.) in the ignoreList are allowed to maintain their casing
  - Grammatical words (like "and", "or", "the", etc.) are allowed to be all lowercase

##### Configuration
This rule includes two configuration options:
  - `ignoreList`: Words that are allowed to maintain their specific casing (e.g., "API", "AWS", "DNS")
  - `grammaticalWords`: Common words that can remain lowercase in titles (e.g., "and", "or", "the")
