    description: |
      Delete method response should not have schema reference to object.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies to 204 responses in DELETE methods for single resource endpoints (with path parameters)
        - Verifies that the response does not contain a schema property
        - Fails if any content type in the response has a defined schema as reference
        - Skips validation for collection endpoints (without path parameters)

    description: |
      DELETE method must return 204 No Content.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies to all DELETE methods for single resource endpoints (with path parameters)
        - Verifies the 204 No Content response code is present
        - Fails if the method lacks a 204 No Content response or defines a different 2xx status code
        - Ensures no other 2xx response codes are defined
        - Fails if the 204 status code is missing or if other 2xx responses exist
        - Skips validation for collection endpoints (without path parameters)

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies to all DELETE methods for single resource endpoints (with path parameters)
        - Verifies that the operation object does not contain a requestBody property
        - Fails if any requestBody is defined for the DELETE method
        - Skips validation for collection endpoints (without path parameters)
