rules:
  xgen-IPA-108-delete-response-should-be-empty:
    description: |
      Delete method response should not have schema reference to object.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies to 204 responses in DELETE methods for single resource endpoints (with path parameters)
        - Verifies that the response does not contain a schema property
        - Fails if any content type in the response has a defined schema as reference
        - Skips validation for collection endpoints (without path parameters)
    message: '{{error}} https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-108-delete-response-should-be-empty'
    severity: error

  xgen-IPA-108-delete-method-return-204-response:
    description: |
      DELETE method must return 204 No Content.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies to all DELETE methods for single resource endpoints (with path parameters)
        - Verifies the 204 No Content response code is present
        - Fails if the method lacks a 204 No Content response or defines a different 2xx status code
        - Ensures no other 2xx response codes are defined
        - Fails if the 204 status code is missing or if other 2xx responses exist
        - Skips validation for collection endpoints (without path parameters)

  xgen-IPA-108-delete-request-no-body:
    description: |
      DELETE method must not have request body.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies to all DELETE methods for single resource endpoints (with path parameters)
        - Verifies that the operation object does not contain a requestBody property
        - Fails if any requestBody is defined for the DELETE method
        - Skips validation for collection endpoints (without path parameters)
    message: '{{error}} https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-108-delete-request-no-body'
    severity: error
    given: '#DeleteOperationObject'
    then:
      function: IPA108DeleteMethodNoRequestBody
  xgen-IPA-108-valid-operation-id:
    description: |
      The Operation ID must start with the verb “delete” and should be followed by a noun or compound noun.
      The noun(s) in the Operation ID should be the collection identifiers from the resource identifier in singular form.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to DELETE methods that are not [custom methods](https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/109)
        - Confirms that the existing OperationId is compliant with generated IPA Compliant OperationId
      ##### Configuration
      This rule includes two configuration options:
        - `methodName`: The verb to be used in the OperationIds
        - `ignoreSingularizationList`: Words that are allowed to maintain their assumed plurality (e.g., "Fts")
