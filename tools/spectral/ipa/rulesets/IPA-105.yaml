      The List method must return a 200 OK response.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to GET methods on resource collection paths
        - Ignores singleton resources
        - Verifies the 200 OK response code is present
        - Fails if the method lacks a 200 OK response or defines a different 2xx status code

      The List method request must not include a body.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to GET methods on resource collection paths
        - Ignores singleton resources
        - Verifies that the operation object does not contain a requestBody property

    description: |
      APIs must provide a List method for resources.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to resource collection paths
        - Ignores singleton resources
        - Verifies the resource path has a GET method
        - Fails if the resource path does not have a GET method

    description: >-
      The response body of the List method should consist of the same resource object returned by the Get method.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to resource collection paths with JSON content types
        - Ignores singleton resources
        - Ignores responses without a schema or non-paginated responses
        - A response is considered paginated if it has a schema with a 'results' array property
        - Verifies that the schema of items in the 'results' array matches the schema used in the Get method response
        - Fails if the Get method doesn't have a schema reference or if the schemas don't match
        - Validation ignores resources without a Get method
        - Paths with `x-xgen-IPA-exception` for this rule are excluded from validation
