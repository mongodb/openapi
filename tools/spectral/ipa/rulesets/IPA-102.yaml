# IPA-102: Resource Identifiers

rules:
  xgen-IPA-102-collection-identifier-camelCase:
    description: |
      Collection identifiers must be in camelCase.

       ##### Implementation details
       Rule checks for the following conditions:

         - All path segments that are not path parameters
         - Only the resource identifier part before any colon in custom method paths (e.g., `resource` in `/resource:customMethod`)
         - Path parameters should also follow camelCase naming
         - Certain values can be exempted via the ignoredValues configuration that can be supplied as `ignoredValues` 
         argument to the rule
         - Paths with `x-xgen-IPA-exception` for this rule are excluded from validation
         - Double slashes (//) are not allowed in paths
         - If any parent path has an exception for this rule, the exception will be inherited.

  xgen-IPA-102-path-alternate-resource-name-path-param:
    description: |
      Paths should alternate between resource names and path params.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:

        - Paths must follow a pattern where resource names and path parameters strictly alternate
        - Even-indexed path segments should be resource names (not path parameters)
        - Odd-indexed path segments should be path parameters
        - Paths with `x-xgen-IPA-exception` for this rule are excluded from validation
        - If any parent path has an exception for this rule, the exception will be inherited.

  xgen-IPA-102-collection-identifier-pattern:
    description: |
      Collection identifiers must begin with a lowercase letter and contain only ASCII letters and numbers.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:

        - All path segments that are not path parameters must match pattern `/^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$/`
        - Path parameters (inside curly braces) are excluded from validation
        - Custom methods (segments containing colons) are excluded from validation
        - Paths with `x-xgen-IPA-exception` for this rule are excluded from validation
        - Each non-parameter path segment must start with a lowercase letter followed by any combination of ASCII letters and numbers
        - If any parent path has an exception for this rule, the exception will be inherited.
