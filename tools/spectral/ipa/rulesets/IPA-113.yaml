rules:
  xgen-IPA-113-singleton-must-not-have-id:
    description: |
      Singleton resources must not have a user-provided or system-generated ID.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to singleton resources that are identified as resource collection identifiers
        - Checks that the resource has a GET method defined
        - Examines all 2xx response schemas from the GET method
        - Verifies that no schema contains 'id' or '_id' properties in their object definitions
        - Fails if any response schema contains these identifier properties

  xgen-IPA-113-singleton-must-not-have-delete-method:

      Singleton resources must not define the Delete standard method.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to singleton resources
        - Checks that the resource does not have a DELETE method defined
    message: '{{error}} https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-113-singleton-must-not-have-delete-method'

  xgen-IPA-113-singleton-should-have-update-method:
    description: |
      Singleton resources should define the Update method. Validation for the presence of Get method is covered by IPA-104 (see [xgen-IPA-104-resource-has-GET](https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-104-resource-has-GET)).

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to singleton resources
        - Excludes read-only singleton resources (where all properties in the GET response schema are marked as readOnly; for List responses, all properties in the items schema must be readOnly)
        - Checks that the resource has the PUT and/or PATCH methods defined
    message: '{{error}} https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-113-singleton-should-have-update-method'
