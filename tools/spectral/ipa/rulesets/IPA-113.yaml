    description: |
      Singleton resources must not have a user-provided or system-generated ID.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to singleton resources that are identified as resource collection identifiers
        - Checks that the resource has a GET method defined
        - Examines all 2xx response schemas from the GET method
        - Verifies that no schema contains 'id' or '_id' properties in their object definitions
        - Fails if any response schema contains these identifier properties
    message: '{{error}} https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-113-singleton-must-not-have-id'
    severity: warn
