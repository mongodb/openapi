      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to singleton resources that are identified as resource collection identifiers
        - Checks that the resource has a GET method defined
        - Examines all successful response schemas from the GET method
        - Verifies that no schema contains 'id' or '_id' properties in their object definitions
        - Fails if any response schema contains these identifier properties
