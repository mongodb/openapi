rules:
  xgen-IPA-104-resource-has-GET:
    description: |
      APIs must provide a Get method for resources.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Only applies to resource collection identifiers
        - For singleton resources, verifies the resource has a GET method
        - For regular resources, verifies there is a single resource path with a GET method
    message: '{{error}} https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-104-resource-has-GET'
    severity: error
    given: '$.paths'

  xgen-IPA-104-get-method-returns-single-resource:
    description: |
      The purpose of the Get method is to return data from a single resource.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to 2xx responses of GET methods on single resources or singleton resources
        - Verifies the response is not an array or paginated result
        - Different error messages are provided for standard vs singleton resources
    message: '{{error}} https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-104-get-method-returns-single-resource'

  xgen-IPA-104-get-method-response-code-is-200:
    description: |
      The Get method must return a 200 OK response.
      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to GET methods on single resources or singleton resources
        - Verifies the 200 OK response code is present
        - Fails if the method lacks a 200 OK response or defines a different 2xx status code
    message: '{{error}} https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-104-get-method-response-code-is-200'

  xgen-IPA-104-get-method-returns-response-suffixed-object:
    description: |
      The Get method of a resource should return a "Response" suffixed object.
      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to 2xx responses of GET methods on single resources or singleton resources
        - Verifies the schema references a predefined schema (not inline)
        - Confirms the referenced schema name ends with "Response" suffix
    message: '{{error}} https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-104-get-method-returns-response-suffixed-object'

  xgen-IPA-104-get-method-response-has-no-input-fields:
    description: |
      The Get method response object must not include writeOnly properties (fields that should be used only on creation or update, ie output fields).
      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to 2xx responses of GET methods on single resources or singleton resources
        - Searches through the schema to find any properties marked with writeOnly attribute
        - Fails if any writeOnly properties are found in the response schema

  xgen-IPA-104-get-method-no-request-body:
    description: |
      The Get method request must not include a body.
      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to GET methods on single resources or singleton resources
        - Verifies that the operation object does not contain a requestBody property
    message: '{{error}} https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-104-get-method-no-request-body'

    given: '#GetOperationObject'
    then:

  xgen-IPA-104-valid-operation-id:
    description: |
      The Operation ID must start with the verb “get” and should be followed by a noun or compound noun.
      The noun(s) in the Operation ID should be the collection identifiers from the resource identifier in singular form.
      If the resource is a singleton resource, the last noun may be the plural form of the collection identifier.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to GET methods on single resources or singleton resources
        - Confirms that the existing OperationId is compliant with generated IPA Compliant OperationId

      ##### Configuration
      This rule includes two configuration options:
        - `methodName`: The verb to be used in the OperationIds
        - `ignoreSingularizationList`: Words that are allowed to maintain their assumed plurality (e.g., "Fts")
    message: '{{error}} https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-104-valid-operation-id'

  xgen-IPA-104-operation-id-length:
    description: |
      The Operation ID should not be longer than 4 words. If the generated operation ID exceeds 4 words,
      add an 'x-xgen-operation-id-override' extension with a shorter operation ID.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to GET methods on single resources or singleton resources
        - Verifies that the operation ID is not longer than 4 words
        - If the operation ID is longer than 4 words, requires an 'x-xgen-operation-id-override' extension
        - Can be exempted using 'x-xgen-IPA-exception' for APIs where long operation IDs are intentional

      ##### Configuration
      This rule includes three configuration options:
        - `methodName`: The verb to be used in the OperationIds
        - `ignoreSingularizationList`: Words that are allowed to maintain their assumed plurality (e.g., "Fts")
        - `maxLength`: The maximum number of words allowed in the operation ID (default: 4)
