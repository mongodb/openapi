    description: |
      The Create method request should be a Request suffixed object.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to POST methods on resource collection paths (non-singleton resources)
        - Applies only to JSON content types
        - Verifies the schema references a predefined schema (not inline)
        - Confirms the referenced schema name ends with "Request" suffix

  xgen-IPA-106-create-method-should-not-have-query-parameters:
    description: |
      Create operations should not use query parameters.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to POST methods on resource collection paths (non-singleton resources)
        - Verifies the operation does not contain query parameters
        - Ignores specified parameters like 'pretty' and 'envelope' via configuration

  xgen-IPA-106-create-method-request-body-is-get-method-response:
    description: |
      Request body content of the Create method and response content of the Get method should refer to the same resource.

      ##### Implementation details

      Validation checks the POST method for resource collection paths.
        - Validation ignores resources without a Get method.
        - `readOnly:true` properties of Get method response will be ignored.
        - `writeOnly:true` properties of Create method request will be ignored.
        - Property comparison is based on `type` and `name` matching.
        - `oneOf` and `discriminator` definitions must match exactly.

  xgen-IPA-106-create-method-request-has-no-readonly-fields:
    description: |
      Create method Request object must not include fields with readOnly:true.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to POST methods on resource collection paths (non-singleton resources)
        - Applies only to JSON content types
        - Searches through the request schema to find any properties marked with readOnly attribute
        - Fails if any readOnly properties are found in the request schema

  xgen-IPA-106-create-method-response-code-is-201:
    description: |
      Create methods must return a 201 Created response code.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to POST methods on resource collection paths (non-singleton resources)
        - Verifies the 201 Created response code is present
        - Fails if the method lacks a 201 Created response or defines a different 2xx status code
    message: '{{error}} https://mdb.link/mongodb-atlas-openapi-validation#xgen-IPA-106-create-method-response-code-is-201'

    description: |
      The response body of the Create method should consist of the same resource object returned by the Get method.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to POST methods on resource collection paths
        - Applies only to JSON response content types
        - Verifies that both Create and Get methods have schema references
        - Confirms that the Create method 201 response schema reference matches the Get method response schema reference
        - Ignores resources without a Get method
        - Paths with `x-xgen-IPA-exception` for this rule are excluded from validation

  xgen-IPA-106-readonly-resource-should-not-have-create-method:
    description: |
      Read-only resources must not define the Create method.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies to POST methods on resource collection paths
        - Checks if the resource is a read-only resource (all properties in GET response have readOnly:true)
        - If a resource does not have a standard GET method, it is not considered read-only (cannot determine the resource schema)
        - Fails if a Create method is defined on a read-only resource
        - Operation objects with `x-xgen-IPA-exception` for this rule are excluded from validation

  xgen-IPA-106-valid-operation-id:
    description: |
      The Operation ID must start with the verb “create” and should be followed by a noun or compound noun.
      The noun(s) in the Operation ID should be the collection identifiers from the resource identifier in singular form.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to POST methods that are not [custom methods](https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/109)
        - Confirms that the existing OperationId is compliant with generated IPA Compliant OperationId

      ##### Configuration
      This rule includes two configuration options:
        - `methodName`: The verb to be used in the OperationIds
        - `ignoreSingularizationList`: Words that are allowed to maintain their assumed plurality (e.g., "Fts")

  xgen-IPA-106-operation-id-length:
    description: |
      The Operation ID should not be longer than 4 words. If the generated operation ID exceeds 4 words,
      add an 'x-xgen-operation-id-override' extension with a shorter operation ID.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to POST methods that are not [custom methods](https://mongodb.github.io/ipa/109)
        - Verifies that the operation ID is not longer than 4 words
        - If the operation ID is longer than 4 words, requires an 'x-xgen-operation-id-override' extension
        - Can be exempted using 'x-xgen-IPA-exception' for APIs where long operation IDs are intentional

      ##### Configuration
      This rule includes two configuration options:
        - `methodName`: The verb to be used in the OperationIds
        - `ignoreSingularizationList`: Words that are allowed to maintain their assumed plurality (e.g., "Fts")
