  xgen-IPA-125-oneOf-must-have-discriminator:
    description: |
      Each oneOf property must include a discriminator property to define the exact type.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies only to schemas with `oneOf` containing references
        - Ensures a `discriminator` property is present with a valid `propertyName`
        - Validates that `discriminator.mapping` contains exactly the same number of entries as `oneOf` references
        - Validates that each `discriminator.mapping` value matches a reference in the `oneOf` array
        - Ignores `oneOf` definitions with inline schemas

      ##### Matching Logic
      - The `discriminator.mapping` must have the same number of entries as there are references in the `oneOf` array
      - Each value in the `discriminator.mapping` must match one of the `$ref` values in the `oneOf` array
      - Each `$ref` in the `oneOf` array must have a corresponding entry in the `discriminator.mapping`
      - Example:
        ```yaml
        oneOf:
          - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Dog'
          - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Cat'
        discriminator:
          propertyName: type
          mapping:
            dog: '#/components/schemas/Dog'
            cat: '#/components/schemas/Cat'
        ```
        This is valid because there are exactly 2 mappings for 2 oneOf references, and all values match.

  xgen-IPA-125-oneOf-no-base-types:
    description: |
      API producers should not use oneOf with base types like integer, string, boolean, or number.

      ##### Implementation details
      Rule checks for the following conditions:
        - Applies to schemas with `oneOf` arrays
        - Ensures no element within oneOf has a type property that is a primitive/base type
        - Base types considered are: integer, string, boolean, number

      ##### Rationale
      Using oneOf with primitive types can lead to ambiguity and validation problems. Clients may not 
      be able to properly determine which type to use in which context. Instead, use more specific 
      object types with clear discriminators.

      ##### Example Violation
      ```yaml
      # Incorrect - Using oneOf with base types
      type: object
      properties:
        value:
          oneOf:
            - type: string
            - type: integer
      ```

      ##### Example Compliance
      ```yaml
      # Correct - Using oneOf with object types only
      type: object
      properties:
        value:
          oneOf:
            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/StringValue'
            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/IntegerValue'
          discriminator:
            propertyName: valueType
            mapping:
              string: '#/components/schemas/StringValue'
              integer: '#/components/schemas/IntegerValue'
      ```
