            description: Creates one private endpoint service for the specified cloud service provider. This cloud service provider manages the private endpoint service for the project. When you create a private endpoint service, MongoDB Cloud creates a network container in the project for the cloud provider for which you create the private endpoint service if one doesn't already exist. To learn more about private endpoint terminology in MongoDB Cloud, see Private Endpoint Concepts. To use this resource, the requesting API Key must have the Project Owner role.

            description: Enables or disables the ability to create multiple private endpoints per region in all cloud service providers in one project. The cloud service provider manages the private endpoints for the project. Connection strings to existing multi-region and global sharded clusters change when you enable this setting. You must update your applications to use the new connection strings. This might cause downtime. To use this resource, the requesting API Key must have the Project Owner role and all clusters in the deployment must be sharded clusters. Once enabled, you cannot create replica sets.
