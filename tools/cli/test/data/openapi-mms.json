Provide a programmatic API public key and corresponding private key as the username and password when constructing the HTTP request. For example, to [return database access history](#tag/Access-Tracking/operation/listAccessLogsByClusterName) with [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL), run the following command in the terminal:\n\n```\ncurl --user \"{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}\" \\\n  --digest \\\n  --header \"Accept: application/vnd.atlas.2025-01-01+json\" \\\n  -X GET \"https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v2/groups/{groupId}/dbAccessHistory/clusters/{clusterName}?pretty=true\"\n```\n\nTo learn more, see [Get Started with the Atlas Administration API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/configure-api-access/).

Similarly, deleting a managed namespace doesn't delete the associated collection.\nMongoDB Cloud shards the empty collection using the required location field and a custom shard key. For example, if your custom shard key is `city`, the compound shard key is `location, city`. Each Global Cluster is also associated with one or more Global Writes Zones. When a user creates a Global Cluster, MongoDB Cloud automatically maps each location code to the closest geographical zone. Custom zone mappings allow administrators to override these automatic mappings. For example, a use case might require mapping a location code to a geographically distant zone. Administrators can manage custom zone mappings with the APIs below and the **Global Cluster Configuration** pane when you create or modify your Global Cluster."
