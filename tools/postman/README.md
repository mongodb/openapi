# Postman Collections from OpenAPI

Folder contains the code required to generate the [MongoDB Atlas Postman collections](https://www.postman.com/mongodb-devrel?tab=collections).
Collections are generated from from the MongoDB OpenAPI Specification. 

## Purpose of the project

Scripts allow for the generation of Postman collections from OpenAPI specifications. This allows
the [DevRel Postman workspace](https://www.postman.com/mongodb-devrel?tab=collections) to stay up to date with the latest version of the
API.

Process of updating involves:

1. Fetching OpenAPI file
2. Converting OpenAPI file to Postman Collection
3. Updating information about the Collection
4. Uploading the Collection to Postman

## Postman Collection Generation Workflow

    style B width:160px,height:60px,text-align:center;
    style C width:160px,height:60px,text-align:center;
    style D width:160px,height:60px,text-align:center;
    style E width:160px,height:60px,text-align:center;
```

1. **Fetch the OpenAPI Specification**: Fetch the most recent version of the OpenAPI file.

2. **Apply OpenAPI transformations**: Apply transformations such as removing regex to prepare openapi file for
   conversion.

3. **Convert to Postman Collection**: Use openapi-to-postmanv2 to convert to a Postman Collection.

4. **Apply JSON transformations**: Apply transformations such as changing title, adding links, adding documentation, and preparing Collection
   for upload.

5. **Upload Collection to Postman**: Use the Postman API to upload the Collection to Postman.

## Limitations

Our Postman collection generation has several limitations, meaning some manual user actions may be necessary during setup:

-  Only a single content-type header is supported generation, meaning users may have to manually update this header if the API supports more than one; see docs links on endpoint level
- Only a single auth scheme is supported during generation, meaning users may have to update their auth on the collection level or endpoint level if not selecting the default

## Postman folder structure

- `openapi` - Where the OpenAPI Spec, version information, and fork files are stored
- `tmp` - Where the Postman Collection is generated and the temporary working files are stored
- `scripts` - Where the Bash scripts are stored
- `validation` - Where the files for spectral validation of the generated collection is stored

## Local setup and validation

### Prerequisites

To push to your own workspace via Postman API, [create a private workspace](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/use-workspaces/) and retrieve the workspace id

Then, [create a Postman API Key](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/) that has access to this workspace

### Env var setup

To test the scripts locally, you should set up the required environment variables in `tools/postman/scripts` by creating a `local.env` file populated with the following (at the minimum):

```
BASE_URL=""
WORKSPACE_ID=""
POSTMAN_API_KEY=""
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=""
```

Run `make load-env` to set your required and overriding env vars.

The OpenAPI path for Postman generation and configured feature flags can also be overriden based on provided env vars.

### Running locally

Once env vars are configured, the setup scripts can be run locally using the Make following commands:
- `make fetch_openapi`
- `make convert_to_collection`
- `make transform_collection`
- `make upload_collection`

## Automatic updates

Postman collection is regenerated automatically by github action [`release-spec.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release-spec.yml).
