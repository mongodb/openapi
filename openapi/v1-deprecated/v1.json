Provide a programmatic API public key and corresponding private key as the username and password when constructing the HTTP request. For example, to [return database access history](#tag/Access-Tracking/operation/listAccessLogsByClusterName) with [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL), run the following command in the terminal:\n\n```\ncurl --user \"{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}\" \\\n  --digest \\\n  --header \"Accept: application/json\" \\\n  -X GET \"https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v1.0/groups/{groupId}/dbAccessHistory/clusters/{clusterName}?pretty=true\"\n```\n\nTo learn more, see [Get Started with the Atlas Administration API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/configure-api-access/).

Similarly, deleting a managed namespace doesn't delete the associated collection.\nMongoDB Cloud shards the empty collection using the required location field and a custom shard key. For example, if your custom shard key is `city`, the compound shard key is `location, city`. Each Global Cluster is also associated with one or more Global Writes Zones. When a user creates a Global Cluster, MongoDB Cloud automatically maps each location code to the closest geographical zone. Custom zone mappings allow administrators to override these automatic mappings. For example, a use case might require mapping a location code to a geographically distant zone. Administrators can manage custom zone mappings with the APIs below and the **Global Cluster Configuration** pane when you create or modify your Global Cluster."

Changes to cluster configurations can affect costs.\n\nThe total number of nodes in clusters spanning across regions has a specific constraint on a per-project basis. MongoDB Cloud limits the total number of nodes in other regions in one project to a total of 40. This total excludes Google Cloud regions communicating with each other, shared-tier clusters, or serverless clusters. The total number of nodes between any two regions must meet this constraint. For example, if a project has nodes in clusters spread across three regions: 30 nodes in Region A, 10 nodes in Region B, and 5 nodes in Region C, you can add only 5 more nodes to Region C because if you exclude Region C, Region A + Region B = 40. If you exclude Region B, Region A + Region C = 35, <= 40. If you exclude Region A, Region B + Region C = 15, <= 40. Each combination of regions with the added 5 nodes still meets the per-project constraint. Region A + B = 40. Region A + C = 40. Region B + C = 20. You can't create a multi-region cluster in a project if it has one or more clusters spanning 40 or more nodes in other regions. Each project supports up to 25 database deployments.\n\nIf your MongoDB Cloud project contains a custom role that uses actions introduced in a specific MongoDB version, you must delete that role before you create clusters with an earlier MongoDB version. MongoDB Cloud clusters created after July 2020 use TLS version 1.2 by default. When you create a cluster, MongoDB Cloud creates a network container in the project for the cloud provider to which you deploy the cluster if one doesn't already exist."

        "description": "Update the details for one cluster in the specified project. Clusters contain a group of hosts that maintain the same data set. This resource does not update multi-cloud clusters. To update a multi-cloud cluster, use Update One Advanced Cluster. You can upgrade your cluster only one major version at a time. You can't skip any major versions. Each major version contains some features that might not be backward-compatible with previous versions. Check the Release Notes for changes that might affect your applications. After you upgrade the MongoDB major version, you will not be able to downgrade to previous versions.\n\n As of MongoDB version 4.2, Legacy Backups are deprecated in favor of Cloud Backups. When you upgrade to version 4.2 or later, your backup system upgrades to Cloud Backups if it is currently set to Legacy Backup. After this upgrade, all your existing legacy backup snapshots remain available. They expire over time in accordance with your retention policy. Your backup policy resets to the default schedule. If you had a custom backup policy in place with legacy backups, you must re-create it with the procedure outlined in the [Cloud Backup documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/backup/cloud-backup/scheduling/#std-label-cloud-provider-backup-schedule).\n\n To use this resource, the requesting Service Account or API Key must have the Project Cluster Manager role. This feature isn't available for `M0` free clusters, `M2` and `M5` shared-tier, and Flex clusters.\n\n The total number of nodes in clusters spanning across regions has a specific constraint on a per-project basis. MongoDB Cloud limits the total number of nodes in other regions in one project to a total of 40. This total excludes Google Cloud regions communicating with each other, free clusters, or shared clusters. The total number of nodes between any two regions must meet this constraint. For example, if a project has nodes in clusters spread across three regions: 30 nodes in Region A, 10 nodes in Region B, and 5 nodes in Region C, you can add only 5 more nodes to Region C because if you exclude Region C, Region A + Region B = 40. If you exclude Region B, Region A + Region C = 35, <= 40. If you exclude Region A, Region B + Region C = 15, <= 40. Each combination of regions with the added 5 nodes still meets the per-project constraint: Region A + B = 40, Region A + C = 40, and Region B + C = 20. You can't create a multi-region cluster in a project if it has one or more clusters spanning 40 or more nodes in other regions.",
