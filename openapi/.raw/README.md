## Raw / Unfiltered OAS

The OAS stored in this folder is only useable for linting and tools that require `x-xgen` type of extensions. To leverage the already applied filters, use [v2.yaml](https://github.com/mongodb/openapi/blob/main/openapi/v2.yaml) or [v2.json](https://github.com/mongodb/openapi/blob/main/openapi/v2.json)
