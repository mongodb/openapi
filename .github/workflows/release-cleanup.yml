            # Description
            This PR deletes files related to an `Upcoming` api that has been released to a `Stable` API.
            
            ## Why?
            The MongoDB Admin API renders OpenAPI specifications and changelog files from this repository. 
            Since this API version is now `Stable`, the files corresponding to its previous `Upcoming` state are obsolete.
            Deleting these files prevents the Admin API from inadvertently displaying outdated or irrelevant information from these older specifications and changelogs.
